     <h1>Joke 1</h1>
     <p>Why did the math book look sad?<br>
Because it had too many problems… and whenever it tried to solve one, another one multiplied!</p>

<p>It even went to therapy, but all it did was divide the room and make everything more complicated.</p>

<p>Poor thing just couldn't find the right solution.</p>>
